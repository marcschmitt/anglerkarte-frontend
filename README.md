# Interactiv Fishingmap - Saar

As a passionate fisherman I created a interactiv Map to show proctected and forbidden zones, where fishing is not allowed in the rhineland-palatinate section of river "Saar" in Germany. I added legal notes to specific areas. Fellow fisherman are able to use the geolocation feature to check, if there are able to fish in their choosen fishing spot.

# Technologies Used

## Front-end

- React
- TailwindCSS
- React Leaflet

## Back-end

- Strapi

# Approach Taken

I started to set up a strapi backend and created the content types for the application. I tested the API so that I can make get and post request on the backend using Postman. I then started to build the frontend using React and TailwindCSS. I implemented the react leaflet library and used geojson.io to draw polylines and polygons on map zones and stored the nodes inside the strapi backend.
